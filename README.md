- ðŸŒ± If you want to explore and practice more on Ai Assistance. here, you can find how to implement it using basics libraries to automate your tasks like send email, search, take notes and save important information

- ### ðŸ”­ I used Libs like:

    ####  Pyttsx3:

              It's a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. It allows you to convert written text into spoken words.

  ####    SpeechRecognition:

              It allows us to recognize speech from audio files or live microphones.

  ####   SMTP:

              It is a built-in module used for sending emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It provides a way to connect to an SMTP server and send email messages programmatically.
      


- ðŸŒ± If you want to take further step, I recommend to use Agents from [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/) or if you wanna no code , you can use [n8n](https://n8n.io/?ps_partner_key=YmlubmJiMTAzMQ&ps_xid=qQ6UJwuXrxq8WA&gsxid=qQ6UJwuXrxq8WA&gspk=YmlubmJiMTAzMQ&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAsOq6BhDuARIsAGQ4-zihcGvxxCwXLBcby3hHVD7BvEvOmtmkYTbsrTlsm9tmSUczJsBjVhgaAuu7EALw_wcB) tool
